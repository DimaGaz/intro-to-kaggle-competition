# Introduction
This is going to be my first experince with a real repo management. For this exercise, I will do an interactive course from Datacamp/[Machine Learning Scientist with Python track](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python?version=1).

# INTERACTIVE COURSE: Winning a Kaggle Competition in Python
_"Kaggle is the most famous platform for Data Science competitions. Taking part in such competitions allows you to work with real-world datasets, explore various machine learning problems, compete with other participants and, finally, get invaluable hands-on experience. In this course, you will learn how to approach and structure any Data Science competition. You will be able to select the correct local validation scheme and to avoid overfitting. Moreover, you will master advanced feature engineering together with model ensembling approaches. All these techniques will be practiced on Kaggle competitions datasets."_([Ref.](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/winning-a-kaggle-competition-in-python))

These course consists of four parts:
1. Kaggle competitions process
2. Dive into the Competition
3. Feature Engineering
4. Modeling
